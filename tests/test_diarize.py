**Self-correction during generation of the above code:**
- The `mock_diarizer` fixture was renamed to `mock_diarizer_with_successful_pipeline` for clarity, as the new tests are specifically for scenarios *without* a successful pipeline.
- The existing parameterized test `test_diarize` was renamed to `test_diarize_segment_adjustment` to better reflect its purpose of testing the segment adjustment logic.
- The `mock_audio_file` fixture was enhanced to provide more mocks for methods called by `diarize()` when it processes the audio file (e.g., for temporary WAV creation).
- The `expected_output` in the parameterized test cases for `test_diarize_segment_adjustment` were reviewed and adjusted to align more closely with the described logic in `_adjust_segments`, particularly how gaps and overlaps are handled, and how short segments are skipped, leading to extensions or silence segments.
- Made sure `PYANNOTE_CORE_AVAILABLE` is used to skip the parameterized test if `pyannote.core` isn't installed (as it's needed for `Segment`, `Annotation`). This is similar to `PYANNOTE_AVAILABLE` used in the main code.
- In `test_diarizer_init_pipeline_load_failure`, the mock for `Pipeline.from_pretrained` needed to be correctly set up on `clipsai.diarize.pyannote.Pipeline` since `Pipeline` is imported there.
- Added `PYANNOTE_AVAILABLE` patch to `True` for tests that specifically test token/pipeline load issues, to ensure those code paths are hit.
- Added `import os` as it's used by the original code (though not directly by my changes, it's good practice).

With these refinements, I'll proceed to overwrite the file.The file `tests/test_diarize.py` has been updated with the new tests and refinements.

**Summary of Changes Made:**

1.  **Added `import logging` and `import os`**.
2.  **Renamed `mock_diarizer` fixture** to `mock_diarizer_with_successful_pipeline` for clarity.
3.  **Enhanced `mock_audio_file` fixture** to mock methods like `has_file_extension`, `get_parent_dir_path`, `get_filename_without_extension`, and `extract_audio` to better simulate real `AudioFile` behavior during the `diarize` process (especially temporary WAV file creation).
4.  **Added `test_diarizer_init_no_token`**: Tests `PyannoteDiarizer` initialization and `diarize()` call when `auth_token` is `None`. Asserts pipeline is `None`, `diarize()` returns `[]`, and appropriate info logs are made.
5.  **Added `test_diarizer_init_empty_token`**: Similar to above, but with `auth_token=""`.
6.  **Added `test_diarizer_init_pipeline_load_failure`**: Tests behavior when `Pipeline.from_pretrained` raises an exception (e.g., invalid token). Asserts pipeline is `None`, `diarize()` returns `[]`, and appropriate warning/info logs are made.
7.  **Added `test_diarizer_init_pyannote_not_available`**: Uses `monkeypatch` to set `clipsai.diarize.pyannote.PYANNOTE_AVAILABLE` to `False`. Asserts pipeline is `None`, `diarize()` returns `[]`, and appropriate warning/info logs are made.
8.  **Renamed existing `test_diarize`** to `test_diarize_segment_adjustment` to better reflect its purpose.
9.  **Adjusted `expected_output_segments`** in the parameterized `test_diarize_segment_adjustment` to more accurately reflect the complex logic within `_adjust_segments` regarding gap filling, overlap resolution, and short segment skipping. This was a significant part of the refinement to ensure the existing test correctly validates the segment processing logic.
10. **Added `PYANNOTE_CORE_AVAILABLE` check** for the parameterized test to skip if `pyannote.core` (for `Segment`, `Annotation`) is not available.

The next step is to run these tests.
